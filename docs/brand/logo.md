> The Yale School of Management logo consists of a shield, designed in the early history of the school, and a wordmark, created according to Yale Universityâ€™s identity standards.

There are two versions of the logo: the one-line logo and the exdent logo. Exdent is preferred where space allows. See [resources] for full brand guidelines on logo use.
